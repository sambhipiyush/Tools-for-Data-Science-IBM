# Data Scientist

# *I am interested in data science because of the following reasons*
# 
# 1. *I love telling stories with data and using data to help bring that data to life. As a data scientist I can turn seemingly meaningless data into a recommendation to help a company improve its product, services, or experiences. This can help a business grow or get more clients.*
# 
# 1. *I am a technophile. I love using the latest and greatest technology. Whether that is hardware or software, I enjoy getting my hands on with these new technologies to see how that can enrich our lives.*
# 
# 1. *Possibly the number one reason I got into data science, I have a passion for helping. In data science that could be helping a business understand its customers or improving the way it uses its customer data. I get a fantastic feeling of job satisfaction when I see the fruits of my labor helping in many different ways.*

length = 5
width = 3
area = area_of_rectangle(length, width)
print('Area of rectangle is ', area)
