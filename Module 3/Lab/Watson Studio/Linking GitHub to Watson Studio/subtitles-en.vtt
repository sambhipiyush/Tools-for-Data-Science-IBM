credentials replaced with X's it's a

24
00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.950
best practice to remove or replace

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.400
credentials before publishing to github

26
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.710

option to publish content without hidden

30
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.010
code which means that any cells in the

31
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.950
notebook that began with the hidden cell

32
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.340

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.260
published

36
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.070
successfully and provides links to the

37
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.380
notebook the repository in the commit

38
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.870
let's take a look at the commits so

39
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.000
there's the commit and you can navigate

40
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.420
to the repository to see the publish

41
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.420
notebook

42
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.160
lastly you can publish as a gist just

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.940
are another way to share your work on

44
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.310
github every gist is a git repository so

45
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.160
it can be forked and cloned there are

46
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.190
two types of gists public and secret if

47
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.440
you start out with a secret gist you can

48
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.630
convert it to a public gist later and

49
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.830
again you have the option to remove

50
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.410
hidden cells

51
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.530
so that's the basics of Watson Studios

52
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.800
github integration

53
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.800
